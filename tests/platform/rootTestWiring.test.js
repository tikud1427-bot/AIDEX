/**
 * The root test command and CI must run the SAME battery.
 *
 * 🔴 THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES
 * -------------------------
 * `test:aqua` enumerated five of aqua's twenty-two test scripts by hand:
 *
 *     cd aqua && npm run test:edit && npm run test:upload
 *             && npm run test:identity && npm run test:search
 *             && npm run test:account
 *
 * Measured against a real run: that is 239 aqua tests. `cd aqua && npm test`
 * is 2886. So `npm test` at the repo root reported a green battery of ~320
 * while leaving 2647 aqua tests unrun — among them EVERY test for the thing
 * this project is about:
 *
 *     eval/tests   the gate, and every committed baseline's findings
 *     src/brain    understanding, context engine, claims, reflection
 *     src/pic      retrieval, the relevance gate, the polarity lane
 *     src/core     the claim substrate
 *     src/memory, src/mind, src/cognition, src/understanding,
 *     src/files, src/routes, src/orchestrator, src/providers,
 *     src/embeddings, src/intelligence, src/artifacts
 *
 * CI was never wrong — `.github/workflows/eval-gate.yml` sets
 * `working-directory: aqua` and runs the full suite plus the gate. The trap was
 * local: a developer changing `src/brain`, running `npm test` at the root, and
 * getting a green result from a command that never loaded the file they edited.
 *
 * A HAND-MAINTAINED LIST OF WHAT TO BE COMPLETE OVER IS NOT COMPLETENESS.
 * The eval gate's own baseline tests settled this argument once already and
 * were rewritten to read the directory instead of naming its contents. The
 * same rule applies to a test command: delegating to `npm test` inside `aqua`
 * means a new suite is covered the moment it exists, with nobody to remember.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS, STATED PLAINLY: the root battery goes from seconds to about
 * two minutes. That is the price of the command meaning what it says, and it
 * is the same wall-clock CI has always paid.
