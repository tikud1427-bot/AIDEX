/**
 * Launch safety + the first-run funnel.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE STATIC ASSERTIONS AND NOT A BOOTED APP
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * `startServer()` awaits a live Mongo connection before it listens, so there is
 * no way to stand this app up in a test process without a database. Stubbing
 * mongoose far enough to get past model compilation produces a fake app, and a
 * green result against a fake app is worth less than no result — it is the same
 * trap as proving a module while its wiring stays unverified.
 *
 * So this suite pins the two things that CAN be checked without a database:
 * that the middleware is present in the right ORDER, and that the redirect
 * decision is what it claims to be. The behaviour of helmet and
 * express-rate-limit themselves is their maintainers' job, not ours; what is
 * ours is whether they are mounted where they can do anything.
 *
 * The end-to-end check belongs in a real environment. See LAUNCH_SAFETY_APPLY.md
 * for the three curl commands.
